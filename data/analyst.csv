Data Scientist,Zurich Insurance,"Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",Unknown,"
Our opportunity 

Within the Data and Business Intelligence area, DBI Studio is responsible for building the solutions which support the Group’s decision making and efficiency. We have a truly global reach: our internal clients are Group Functions responsible for the Group’s core processes and Business Units bringing Zurich’s products and services to all geographic areas.

The activity of DBI Studio’s Data Science team is instrumental to Zurich’s transformation into a data-driven organization. Working shoulder to shoulder with engineers, designers, product managers and business stakeholders, we deliver effective models and reusable products. We strive for robustness, safety and clarity. We are adaptable and make it a point to never stick to our comfort zone and constantly push the boundary of the technologies and models available to Zurich.

By joining us, you will be part of a team committed to make things better day after day and to invest in each other’s growth. Your work will support processes and decisions that reach millions of customers and you will gain the experience (and satisfaction!) that only facing problems that you’ve never seen before and overcoming new challenges can bring.

 Your role 

As a data scientist your main responsibilities will involve work collaboratively on building models and analyses to support internal products or the business’s decision processes, producing code and experiments that be reproducible and maintainable as well as informing the group’s digital strategy.

What does that mean in practice?

It means that over the course of just a few months you may be testing computer vision models to assess the damage of a car accident from a photo; you may be tasked with detecting faulty instruments on a factory floor from the data produced by IoT sensors; you may be processing logs to profile web users; or employ large language models to search for concepts through thousands of risk assessment reports, or optimize the condition offerings in our policies. If you thought that the reach of a data scientist within an insurance company would be limited, think again.

Nor should the value that a skilled data scientist can bring be confined to the technical realm! You’ll have the chance to advise core teams with global reach on their digitalization strategy, shape the Group’s AI ethics policies or be involved in every part of the development of a product: from design, to implementation to its financial assessment.

150 years after its foundation, Zurich is still growing and so will your possibilities within it.

Your Skills And Experience

You may have experience building risk scoring models in a bank or studying behavioural patterns in social psychology trials. Perhaps in your free time you have analysed smart contract transaction patterns on crypto platforms. Or you were once asked to optimise the routing of logistical services or the hourly rental price of courts in a tennis club. Maybe during your studies you spent time filtering the massive amount of data produced by particle physics experiments and you now recall with fondness long, late night conversations around the interpretation of p-values. You may have built a system to detect unconscious decision patterns in a corpus of court sentences. It could be that you got tired of always getting the same recommendations on your music streaming platform and tried to reverse-engineer their algorithm. Perhaps you’ve wondered how to use mobile phone signal data to design new bus routes or study how crowds move to optimize the floor layout of a department store.

It doesn’t matter where you come from. The essence of our work is easy: make sense of information; maintain a global perspective (it’s not just about the mathematical model, but rather how it’ll be used); write good code.

As a data scientist your skills and qualifications will ideally include:

 3 years of relevant industry experience (it should be clear by now what we mean by that). If that comes with knowledge of the insurance industry, all the better!  You know your random forest from your logistic regression – and you can explain them clearly to every kind of audience.  You have built a sound knowledge of programming in Python and its most common libraries and frameworks useful for DS (e.g. scikit-learn, pandas, scipy, numpy, networkx, pytorch, keras, pymc3…).  You have hands-on experience with (Py)Spark and can write non-trivial SQL queries,  Have worked in cloud environments, particularly Azure and AWS  And software versioning systems such as Git or SVN are no strangers to you.  You can prove that you can organise, conduct and communicate the results of quantitative experiments;  That you can handle multiple workflows at once, evaluate priorities, work under pressure  And that you work with autonomy and rigour: even in the face of ambiguity, uncertain requirements and lack of information, you plan and get work done.  You can communicate clearly, effectively and empathically  And you know what it means to work in a team.  It goes without saying: in a global organization, fluency in English (written and spoken) is paramount. Additional languages surely won’t hurt. 

Bonus points if you can also show:

 Higher academic education  Knowledge of software engineering basics  Demonstrable experience with seeing your models deployed to production  Experience programming in Scala and R (or indeed some lower-level languages!)  Knowledge of MLOps  Real-world experience with deep learning models  Knowledge of DS platforms such as Dataiku, Knime, DataRobot, H2O etc. 

Additional Information

 As well as a competitive salary and a yearly bonus we offer benefits package which includes: 

 Option to work remotely within Spain even up to 100% - you choose  Flexible working hours  Wide range of internal and external trainings  Free English, German and Spanish classes depending on the needs  Ticket restaurant  Life Insurance  Pension Plan - after 1 year in the company  Referral bonus if you bring other talented people like you  Special banking and insurance conditions  Exclusive Employees discounts 

 Primary work location is Barcelona, Poblenou  . Please apply with your CV in English.

Who We Are

Looking for a challenging and inspiring work environment where you can make a difference? At Zurich millions of individuals and businesses place their trust in our products and services every day. Our 53,000 employees worldwide form the basis of our success, enabling businesses and communities to face a world of risk with confidence. Imagine if you could help people do this all over the world.

Where will you do it?Another way of #KeepRowing is rowing all together in perfect synchronisation and towards a common goal, and what a better place to do it than in our offices in Barcelona, just 200 metres from the sea 🌊. This exceptional location next to the beach is perfect for a break with a dip and to put into practice another of our #HaveFun values


But since 2021 the number of ""Holaluz offices"" has multiplied by more than 500, everyone has their own little Holaluz, with their sea views (or not), their coffee or tea machine, their open space for lunch, their meeting rooms (now with a little more availability), and also their routines and organisation. We are committed to individuality and flexibility by putting people at the core of our decisions, that's why our offices are open for those who need or want to work in them. We are working on flexible seating in the office and providing individual lockers for everyone, as well as adapting all the meeting rooms so that we can make better video-conferencing and continue to work as comfortably as possible from home or from the office. Our people are the most valuable asset, so in the office we must comply with the following agreements:


 It's essential to wear a mask when moving around in the office. Not when we're sitting in our workplace (respecting distances) but when we're moving around (toilets, going to the kitchen, showers or meeting rooms). We now use the elbow bump to greet each other. The cleaning team comes daily to the office but to reinforce this we have cleaning kits in all the meeting rooms and other spaces. On a weekly basis, we have a health team available to carry out Covid tests on people who come to the office. And of course: safety distance, temperature taking, hand washing, flexible seating and restricted external visits. 
Requirements:

What do we need? We'll value experience as a Data analyst, bonus points if your experience comes from partnering with the People function.  Experience managing data projects, including automation and dashboarding.  Knowledge on SQL, basic Python, and being familiar with tools such as ATS and HRIS.  Good understanding of agile mindset and experience pushing the maximum business value with it. 
Benefits:

What do we offer?Another of the values that characterise us at Holaluz is #EsPosible (""It's Possible""). Therefore, we offer a series of measures so that you can develop yourself 360º and achieve everything you set out to do, both personally and professionally. In line with this, we believe that the most powerful energy comes from people, so #AlwaysPeopleFirst is part of our DNA, therefore, you will have the opportunity to:



 Join a company where people come first, with an unbeatable working environment and great talent where we truly live our values - all that while being a goal-oriented and results-driven company that applies agile methodologies and a proven scaling philosophy to everything we do Unlimited professional development in an exciting company and a team fostering and facing together constant challenges: You will join Europe's first B Corp Certified electric utility (companies that innovate to maximise their positive impact on employees, the community they serve and the environment) and the world number 1 electric company in ESG World Rating according to Sustainalytics Have flexible working hours and the possibility of working remotely on a regular basis, as a result of our pro-responsibility and autonomy mentality, and our commitment to the self-management of the team's time. Enjoy a working environment where also the 'details' fit your needs. We have our own library, organic fruit, reduced subscription to Andjoy - which includes yoga and crossfit classes in the office (mens sana in corpore sano) -, and competitive wifi rates with Unique Get a competitive share-based compensation plan Be eligible for a reduced price for private health insurance (Adeslas) Enter a baby-friendly company. Nursery to help integrate life and work for new parents. ""Casals"" (summer camps in summer but also in other holidays) those weeks of the year when combining children's holidays and work becomes a little more complicated. We offer preferential rates for kindergarten, transportation and food with Cobee (our flexible retribution system) Take free English and Catalan lessons at the office Competitive sustainable mobility rate with eCooltra for Holaluz (electric bikes and scooters, so you can get to the office quickly and economically, using individual and ecological transport) 





We celebrate diversity in the world and we want our team to reflect this in an inclusive way. At Holaluz, we are committed to equal employment opportunities regardless of ethnicity, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, marital status, disability, gender, gender identity or expression.

REMOTE DATA SCIENTIST – Build from scratch the best data structure ever,Reflex Leads,"Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",Remote,"
Burn your resume. It doesn’t say anything about you. We first want to know if you can overcome the challenge we give you, and then who you are. Because we don’t recruit a number, but a person; and knowledge can be acquired, not your spirit.
1. Your challenge: as our first data scientist and from our huge database,Find the insights that will propel us into becoming the next leaders in Europe.
2. Our company, in hypergrowth.
The lead generation market is young, as is our company. But our growth is strong: we are twice as big as in 2021. And we don’t lack ambition: we will be European leaders in 5 years.
So your potential for growth within our company is limitless. You won’t have time to get bored: everything moves fast as lightning. And if you kill it, you’ll see in a few days the direct impact you have!
2. The person we need: a senior data scientist, working remotely (or in Barcelona)
1/ You will be our first data scientist. You will create our strategy and data structure from scratch, as well as to educate us. So you need to be experienced, with the caution, logical rigor and skepticism you only acquire through experience.
2/ We won’t micromanage you. Take things into your own hands, be curious, and creative. That’s what you’ll need to find the insights we’ll use both for our long-term strategy, and our day-to-day decision making
3/ You have some experience in quality control, A/B testing and the creation of metrics / data visualization. You’ll be part of Katya’s department, and will also have to dig deep into our back-end technology. But your mission will go as far as you can take it, so we hope you’re excited.
4/ Non-negotiable requirements : strong experience as a data scientist; strong back-end skills (Sql, Python, BI-systems) to be autonomous; perfect english.

4. What we offer: a true career opportunity instead of a number on your face.
Benefits: private health insurance; state-of-the-art Apple equipment; flexible salary; and if you come to Barcelona, a big, bright office with an even cooler kitchen; a ping-pong table, and regular non-work gatherings.
Your future: We’re not a startup, but we’re growing fast.
So we offer you the opportunity to grow faster in 2 years than in 6 in a big company. But we also give you the care and security that startups can't promise: you won't be a number on our screen, but a human being.
Because we’re still only 40 but ambitious, everyone is absolutely essential. So we recruit the best and expect the best. And that’s why we make sure our environment provides everything you need to feel good, relaxed, and excel in your job.
After that, you are the only one responsible for your success. We don’t micromanage. What matters is not the way but the result. At the end of the day, the numbers need to go up while respecting our standards towards our clients, such as:
Complete transparencyExcellence, no matter whatAnd long-term vision
This is why we’re proud of our work.
READY TO APPLY?Then click on “Candidate”.
And instead of asking for a resume,You will just have to answer honestly 4 short and no-nonsense questions (no traps).
Please note that if you do not answer all the questions, your application will be ignored. It’s the only way we can recruit on the basis of skills, attitude and personality, without being overwhelmed by hundreds of useless and uninteresting resumes that don’t say anything about who you really are.

Senior Data Analyst / Data Scientist : UA,Domestika,"Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",Unknown,"
At Domestika we are hiring a Senior Data Analyst/Scientist to work closely with the UA team!

Domestika is the fastest-growing creative community where the best creative experts share their knowledge and skills through professionally produced online courses. It all started as an online forum and a small but dynamic showcase of creative professionals, designed to help them connect and learn from each other. Today, the online community is home to over 6 million people from around the world who are curious and passionate about learning new creative skills.

Team
Data:
The data team partners with all parts of the business to aid decision-making and define measurement frameworks across Domestika. This position is part of Growth Analytics, reporting to the Director of Growth Analytics. You will also work closely with others in the data group such Product Analytics & Data Engineering.
UA:
The UA / Performance Marketing team is responsible for setting & optimizing the acquisition strategy on all Domestika products. It is part of the larger Growth group reporting to the CMO.

Projects

All Analysts in Domestika have their feet in two worlds. On the one hand they must be technical leaders who have the skills to extract, analyze, and visualize data. On the other hand they are partners for their functional teams to measure, support and challenge decision making and strategy.

For this position, some of the specific projects and areas for exploration will include:
 How can we automate and optimize our marketing activities? How can we predict the profitability of our campaigns? How can we measure the incremental value of other channels like SEO, Social Media? How can we model and measure the interaction effects of multi-channel marketing?
Requirements
High level of SQL. You are comfortable navigating raw data and creating aggregate tables. You are comfortable doing this autonomously, but asking for help on occasion from your peers is more than ok. Basic select queries are something you can do with your eyes closed once you are comfortable with the data. You have used window functions to do more complex analyses, but if not, are happy to learn.Prediction & Attribution Knowledge. You have worked on problems that involve prediction or attribution problems. You can comfortably use Python/R to build a basic prediction or forecasting model, and also understand how to build optimization algorithms in a marketing context.

You have used one or more of the popular visualization tools, like Tableau, Looker, or others. In any case, you are able & motivated to pick up new tools, and understand what makes a useful visualization. You have no issue creating quick charts in Excel / Google Sheets to share quick analysis, but at the same time understand the consultation process that comes with building longer lasting dashboards. You much prefer to build something that people will use for a long time, than something that will only be used for a specific analysis.Measurement & Testing Analysis. You understand well the principles of measurement, statistics, and typical user behavior related to pricing & marketing. With all of these, you are equipped to consult on how best to measure the effect of changes, or strategies, and in turn how to improve them. AB testing digital products, in general, is something you have some experience with, but you are also aware of measurement frameworks that don’t necessarily involve formal testing, like attribution, causal impact, or regression.Curiosity & Creativity. Data at Domestika is not a service function. We are creative partners who solve problems and consult on all areas of the business. You should be ready to challenge, to analyze, to improve, to optimize, and to recommend. At the same time, you are humble, collaborative, and driven ultimately by the motivation to make Domestika an amazing experience for our users, and an amazing place to work for your friends and colleagues.Ownership & Product / Project Management. Seniority at Domestika is not about years of experience, it is about autonomy and impact. In this position, you will need to demonstrate ownership and leadership in your area.

Team Lead Data Engineer (f/m/d),Personio,"Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",Hybrid,"
The Role
We are more than a support team. We enable the rapid but sustainable growth of Personio and ensure the financial health and legal stability of the organization. If you want to work and learn in an interdisciplinary team of Finance, Legal, and Business Intelligence and want to make a difference from day one, the BIFL team is the right place for you.
As a Teamlead Data Engineering at Personio, you will have a crucial role at one of the fastest-growing B2B SaaS companies in Europe. In an emerging team, you will build up and extend a data platform, which ensures that we have the best environment to make fast data-driven decisions.
Therefore, we are aiming for a standardized multi-interface data platform that can enable self-service delivery and end-to-end solutions for all data and BI-related use cases at Personio.
With your experience, you will develop a short- and long-term strategy with the team to reach this goal in an iterative way. The overarching architectural paradigm we follow is the Data Mesh as we believe that at the scale Personio is at right now, we can best serve other teams by setting guardrails for interaction with the data platform as well as codifying best practices for ingesting, processing, and querying data. Another important aspect is to enable teams to take end-to-end ownership of their data processing, as the organization has to remain agile, and that extends to the use of data for reporting purposes and for building data products. Concretely, the agility is ensured by us stepping out of the way as much as possible when it comes to the usage and integration of data and instead building a toolset for easy interaction with the data platform on the different layers (ingestion, processing, querying of data). This also includes tools for quality monitoring and making the data accessible via different means, depending on the evolving needs of the organization (e.g. SQL layer, APIs).
Building such a toolset requires empathy for the users as we constantly need to step into their shoes to adequately bridge the gap between their expertise and the data engineering tasks so that they can concentrate on generating business value. It also requires frequent communication with our internal stakeholders to ensure the solution can be evolved continuously and reflects changing requirements over time. To this end, you will get to talk to both technical and non-technical groups of people. Apart from that, you are also willing to organize and develop your team, act as a role model and respected sparring partner, and share your knowledge within relevant groups.
Your tasks and responsibilities will include:
Build, improve and extend a scalable and cloud-based data platform as a service in an iterative way, based on the requirements of our stakeholders and on strategic decisions which you drive with our teamIdentify and provide tools and advice for data ingestion, processing, and analysis and empower other domains in gaining valuable Insights through themBe a proactive member of our data circle in order to drive knowledge exchange across the company and moderate on data engineering topicsDefine and align on interfaces and processes across the organization to make sure that we are working in a scalable environment with high data quality and reliability
What you need to succeed
Experience in leading, developing, and hiring highly qualified data engineers, and organizing them in an optimal team structureExperience in ensuring long term strategic value of engineering solutions and in enabling other teams to make use of themExperience in being a proactive member in federated data groups in order to create an environment where each domain can act independently while ensuring interoperability between themStrong communication skills: Ability to discuss ideas and requirements with stakeholders from different departments and to transport our strategic visionStrong professional work experience within big data environment and in the cloud (e.g. Hadoop, EMR, AWS, Azure,) as well as with Python, Java or ScalaDeep understanding of approaches to data storage and different data architectures (RDMBS, NOSQL databases, OLAP) for driving the evolution of our infrastructureProficiency with SQLPractice in clean code and test-driven developmentKnowledgeable about cloud infrastructure automation and management (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, Gitlab CI, CDK, Terraform)Living agile: Frequent development cycles, continuous delivery and DevOpsLogical and analytical thinking in combination with a high degree of data qualityFluency in English (Level C1/C2)Strong desire to learn about new trends and technologies

Data Engineer,Holaluz.com,"Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",On-site,"
¿Quiénes somos?

Somos Holaluz y nacimos para hacer del mundo, un lugar mejor para todxs. ¿Quieres saber cómo?En este vídeo te lo cuenta Carlota Pi, una de las tres fundadoras de Holaluz. Tú y el planeta sois lo que nos mueve a ser como somos y a hacer lo que hacemos. Uno de nuestros principales valores es #AlwaysPeopleFirst. Por eso, te proponemos seguir creciendo en un entorno

donde el #HaveFun y el #KeepRowing son imprescindibles, pero en el que puedas también desarrollarte 360º.

Nuestra voluntad de hacer las cosas de un modo distinto, nos ha llevado a liderar la transformación del sector eléctrico y a ser la primera eléctrica en obtener el certificado BCorp. En Holaluz:
No vendemos únicamente electricidad 100% de origen renovable, ofrecemos una relación a largo plazo con nuestros clientes basada en la confianza.Gracias al uso de la tecnología, ofrecemos productos personalizados y tarifas que permiten ahorrar a las personas.Convertimos los tejados en energía 100% verde.

Llevamos una década revolucionando el sector de la energía eléctrica. De hecho, estamos transformando los metros cuadrados de los tejados de nuestras ciudades y pueblos en energía 100% verde para todxs. Y lo hemos llamado la Revolución de los Tejados.

Nuestra misión no es otra que conectar a todas las personas a la energía 100% verde y no pararemos hasta conseguirlo.

¿Te sumas?

¿Qué harás?

El foco del día a día está puesto en la resolución de problemas a partir de los datos. El cómo es secundario, se puede escoger cuál es la manera de llegar al resultado que aporte más valor. Desde el equipo de Data Analytics de Holaluz ayudamos a los diferentes equipos de negocio a tomar mejores decisiones mediante insights, dashboards, alertas y modelos estadísticos. Para nosotrxs es fundamental conocer bien los procesos y tener una buena comunicación para aportar el máximo valor posible con los datos. Tenemos la misión de usar los datos para mejorar la vida del cliente.

Aunque hay la libertad de usar diferentes herramientas para generar valor, la arquitectura del equipo está basada en AWS. Gracias a un ETL basado en Pentaho Kettle y scripts en Python (algunos en spark) se integra toda la información interna y externa en nuestro Data Warehouse relacional, aunque estamos implementando un Data Warehouse columnar. No

hay ninguna barrera para integrar datos: las fuentes pueden ser desde typeforms, bases de datos, APIs, hasta GA. Usamos Power BI como herramienta de visualización, aunque para comunicar los insights a los stakeholders usamos las herramientas con las que estamos más cómodxs.

Serás el responsable de que los procesos de integración de datos al Data Warehouse funcionen correctamente, sean escalables y se creen con la mayor calidad posible. Tendrás que evaluar cómo crear los diferentes proyectos para afectar al mínimo al orígen de datos y hasta te tendrás que pelear con diferentes API’s para hacer las integraciones.

Controlarás la infraestructura necesaria para todos los procesos con terraform y en algunos proyectos, tendrás que usar tecnologías Big Data como Spark (pySpark) para llegar a resultados óptimos. Lo más importante será crear un código robusto siguiendo las buenas prácticas para generar valor y ofrecer a los diferentes equipos datos de buena calidad.

El equipo es reactivo y activo. Es decir, los proyectos no sólo se generan a partir de las necesidades comunicadas por las stakeholders, sino que también se puede y es necesario que las personas del equipo propongan proyectos de valor, gracias a su visión transversal de la compañía y su habilidad de trabajar con grandes volúmenes de datos. Es más, se debe ser proactivo para proponer maneras para mejorar el tratamiento de datos. Desde el equipo de Data Analytics no entendemos nuestro día a día sin la innovación. Buscamos cada momento nuevas formas de aportar valor, ya sea a los clientes como a los

otros equipos.

¡Todo son retos en Holaluz ahora mismo!

Y como #SayThingsAsTheyAre es uno de nuestros valores, queremos ser claros y transparentes en explicarte qué harás durante tus primeros 6 meses en Holaluz.

En 30 días...

Después del primer mes ya sabrás cómo está todo montado, te habrás empapado de nuestra cultura y visión, te habrás reunido con todos los equipos y sabrás qué es lo que hacen y qué necesitan.

Empezarás a proporcionar los primeros insights a los equipos y conocerás las estructuras de las bases de datos de Holaluz. También conocerás a los principales stakeholders del equipo y cómo el equipo de BI los puede ayudar con soluciones basadas en data.

Te habrás ido a comer algún día con las personas del equipo, habrás asistido a alguna formación de equipo y hasta algún team building interno.

En 60 días...

Seguro que ya habrás tomado muchas decisiones sobre cómo aportar valor en tu equipo y estarás trabajando codo a codo con tus colegas, en otras palabras, habrás visto la LUZ.

Estarás gestionando las reuniones con los stakeholders y trasladando los retos y tus aportaciones al equipo.

Tendrás el suficiente conocimiento como para proponer nuevas soluciones para los equipos y estarás liderando un proyecto end-to-end.

En 90 días.

Tendrás (casi) todo bajo control y habrás contribuido en la madurez y crecimiento de tu equipo. Habrás aportado valor más allá de tu equipo compartiendo conocimiento, y haciendo valer toda tu experiencia para mejorar el área de Data Analytics.

Tendrás la responsabilidad de proporcionar los procesos y datos a los stakeholders,recogiendo sus necesidades y evaluando su impacto.

Además, habrás tenido varias reuniones con tu responsable para saber cómo te sientes en tus primeros meses con Holaluz.

¿Cómo lo harás?

Otro de nuestros valores es #KeepRowing o seguir remando, lo que significa que el trabajo en equipo y la alineación del mismo es fundamental para poder avanzar y hacer frente a nuestros objetivos compartidos. En Holaluz hemos construido un sistema organizativo robusto y en constante iteración, que permite adaptarnos a los cambios constantes que exige el sector y a conseguir el propósito que perseguimos, utilizando diversas metodologías, entre ellas SCRUM. En Holaluz las reuniones y decisiones se hacen de forma colaborativa, el feedback fluye 🤟 entre los diferentes equipos y se promueve el apoyo entre las personas.

¿Con quién lo harás?

#AlwaysPeopleFirst y #HaveFun son también valores muy importantes en Holaluz, y para pasárselo bien es importante tener un buen equipo de trabajo, por eso te presentamos a las personas con las que trabajarás en tu día a día.

¿Dónde lo harás?

Otra forma de #KeepRowing es remar todos juntos en perfecta sincronización y hacia un objetivo común, y qué mejor lugar para hacerlo que en nuestras oficinas de Barcelona a sólo 200 metros del mar 🤟. Esta excepcional ubicación al lado de la playa es perfecta para hacer un break con chapuzón y poder poner en práctica otro de nuestros valores #HaveFun.

Otra forma de #KeepRowing es remar todos juntos en perfecta sincronización y hacia un objetivo común, y qué mejor lugar para hacerlo que en nuestras oficinas de Barcelona a sólo 200 metros del mar 🤟. Esta excepcional ubicación al lado de la playa es perfecta para hacer un break con chapuzón y poder poner en práctica otro de nuestros valores #HaveFun. Pero desde marzo se han multiplicado por casi 200 las ofis de Holaluz, cada unx tiene su pequeña Holaluz, con sus vistas al mar (o no), su máquina de café o té, su open space para comer, sus salas de reuniones (ahora con un poco más de disponibilidad),

reuniones.)
Ahora apostamos por el ¡Choque de codos! para saludarnosEl equipo de limpieza viene a diario pero para reforzar este punto disponemos de

Senior Data Engineer,Didomi,Spain,Remote,"
Didomi (https://www.didomi.io/) helps companies get in compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. We build a consent management platform that consists of apps, web components, and APIs around collecting, sharing and managing user consents. We know privacy appears to be a boring and hard problem, but we strive to make it interesting and easy to solve for our clients.
We are looking for a senior data engineer with a focus on data engineering to join our product and engineering team. Our main office is in Paris and we are a very distributed team and are open to people working remotely in Europe and the Americas
**What you will do**
Leveraging your experience in building and maintaining complex data pipelines, you will drive the development of our analytics platform currently built on AWS Firehose/Kafka, S3, Athena, and Airflow / EMR / PySpark / TimescaleDB.
We are looking for someone who is eager to:
- Collaborate with other developers to ship new features- Be in charge of the overall architecture of data pipelines- Ensure that we have the right tests and structure in place to make sure that we can move quickly without breaking everything- Share his/her knowledge of data engineering principles and best practices with the team- Keep learning new technologies and be on the look-out for new ideas that we should try out
**What we are looking for**
- A Spark expert- Experience with complex data pipelines and orchestration in the Cloud- Quality-oriented mindset: testing, code reviews, code quality, etc.- Awareness of performance considerations- A passion for simple, maintainable and readable code that balances pragmatism and performance
**How do we build our products?**
We process millions of events every day and are building our analytics platform on Kinesis Firehose / Kafka / S3, with Airflow/PySpark and TimescaleDB to provide an easy-to-use platform for querying and graphing events to everyone in the company and outside.
Most of our front-end applications rely on Angular or React and we also build native mobile SDKs for Android and iOS for our clients to embed in their apps.
Our back-end applications use Feathers or NestJS for building REST and GraphQL APIs. We try to keep our services small and lean and use AWS Lambda/Serverless for background jobs. We leverage PostgreSQL and DynamoDB as our main databases.
We rely on a lot of AWS/GCP services (Beanstalk, Lambda, CloudWatch, S3, etc.) for building, deploying, serving, monitoring and scaling our services. We use Gitlab for our code and issues and our CI, and believe in full automation of our deployment stack with infrastructure-as-code (CloudFormation/Terraform) for everything.
**Our vision as a team**
We are building a product and engineering team that is strongly committed to a high level of quality in our products and code. We believe that automation is the key to consistently achieving that along with velocity of development, joy, and pride in what we deliver.
At Didomi we are organized into feature teams and work with 2-week sprints. We do our best to avoid pointless meetings. The majority of the engineering team works remotely from all over the world, the only hard requirement is a 4-hour overlap with CET working hours.
We rely on automated tests of all sorts (unit, integration, linters, you-name-it!) and continuous integration/delivery to build flexible applications that are able to evolve without breaking. We trust that it enables engineers to focus on the quality of their code and iterate fast without fears of breaking stuff. And when we break stuff, we fix it and learn from our mistakes.
**Hiring process**
Our hiring process has the following steps:- An intro call with an Engineering Manager or the CTO- A code challenge to build a simple Spark application. This is used as the basis of discussion for the next step. You can find our challenge on https://github.com/didomi/challenges/tree/master/data. We also accept suitable open-source projects in place of the challenge. - A 1h code review session and architecture discussion with 3-4 Didomi engineers- A set of 1:1 30-minute calls with the CTO, engineers, and a product manager
For the architecture discussion, we ask you to sketch an architecture (think of event streams, databases, query engines, etc.) and discuss options and trade-offs as we would on a normal day at Didomi.
We understand you already have a job, obligations (and maybe a personal life!) so we'll work with you to make sure it doesn't take up too much of your time while still providing a good basis for a very concrete discussion.

We are Holaluz and we were born to change the world.

You and the planet are what moves us to be who we are and to do what we do. In this video, Carlota Pi, one of the three founders of Holaluz, tells you more about it.

Our desire to do things differently has brought us to lead the transformation of the energy sector. Because:
We only sell 100% renewable electricity.Thanks to leveraging the use of technology, we offer you personalized products and rates that allow you to save money.We put you at the center of all our decisions

There’s more of us wanting to change things. At Holaluz we want to turn every square meter of the roofs into inexhaustible sources of renewable energy for more than 40 million people and at no cost to you.

So that no matter where you live, whether or not you have your own roof,… you can be part of the change just by joining Holaluz's 100% green energy.

The developers of Holaluz work closely with the platform team, and the idea is that the different development teams maintain and scale the infrastructure of their projects, always with the support of the platform team, so we need you to be curious about this branch. Every development team works with IaC, specifically with Terraform and Ansible, we don’t need you to have worked with them, but, in the near future, we will start to work intensively with them. Currently we have an infrastructure set up with the aim of maintaining and improving it day by day.

Another way of #KeepRowing is to row all together in perfect synchronization and towards a common goal, and what better place to do it than in our offices in Barcelona just 200 meters away from the sea 🌊. This exceptional location next to the beach is perfect for taking a break with a dip and putting another of our #HaveFun values into practice.

But since March the number of ""Holaluz offices"" has multiplied by 220, everyone has their own little Holaluz, with their sea views (or not), their coffee or tea machine, their open space for lunch, their meeting rooms (now with a little more availability), and also their routines and organisation. We are committed to individuality and flexibility by putting people at the core of our decisions, that's why our offices are open for those who need or want to work in them. We are working on flexible seating in the office and providing individual lockers for everyone, as well as adapting all the meeting rooms so that we can make better video-conferencing and continue to work as comfortably as possible from home or from the office. Our people are the most valuable asset, so in the office, we must comply with the following agreements:It’s essential to wear a mask when moving around in the office.
