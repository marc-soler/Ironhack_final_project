Data Analyst,OnFrontiers,"Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",Remote,"
OnFrontiers is tackling a problem shared by every institution, company, and team: knowledge is trapped; organizations can’t unlock it fast enough or capture and learn from it to improve over time. As a consequence, their growth and impact fall far short of potential. OnFrontiers exists to solve that problem. We make organizations smarter, on-demand.
We believe tomorrow’s most innovative organizations won't be composed of static org charts with rigid boundaries; they will be more amorphous, supported by a cloud of at-the-ready specialists, on-demand advisors, and a proprietary stable of experts. These organizations will use OnFrontiers tools and the power of networks to access, harness, and distribute expertise within and outside their organization. We’re building an entirely new technology category - a platform and set of applications that fundamentally change how organizations tap into their most valuable resource: knowledge.
Our team is motivated by the drive to fundamentally rethink how organizations operate. This isn’t an academic exercise - we convert our concepts into user-friendly, enterprise-grade tools, and ship those tools to market as quickly as possible. On the back of strong growth in 2020, and with COVID-19 significantly accelerating our trajectory, OnFrontiers is hiring across every function. In the coming months, we’ll be making significant enhancements and major expansions in functionality to our flagship product, and build an entirely new product suite, while dramatically expanding our customer base and expert community.

"Data Analyst, Marketplace",OnFrontiers,"Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",Remote,"
            OnFrontiers is tackling a problem shared by every institution, company, and team: knowledge is trapped; organizations can't unlock it fast enough or capture and learn from it to improve over time. As a consequence, their growth and impact fall far short of potential. OnFrontiers exists to solve that problem. We make organizations smarter, on-demand.

We believe tomorrow's most innovative organizations won't be composed of static org charts with rigid boundaries; they will be more amorphous, supported by a cloud of at-the-ready specialists, on-demand advisors, and a proprietary stable of experts. These organizations will use OnFrontiers tools and the power of networks to access, harness, and distribute expertise within and outside their organization. We're building an entirely new technology category - a platform and set of applications that fundamentally change how organizations tap into their most valuable resource: knowledge.

Our team is motivated by the drive to fundamentally rethink how organizations operate. This isn't an academic exercise - we convert our concepts into user-friendly, enterprise-grade tools, and ship those tools to market as quickly as possible. On the back of strong growth in 2020, and with COVID-19 significantly accelerating our trajectory, OnFrontiers is hiring across every function.

The pricing & revenue team is responsible for setting & optimizing the pricing strategy on all Domestika products. It is part of the larger Growth group reporting to the CMO.
ProjectsAll Analysts in Domestika have their feet in two worlds. On the one hand they must be technical leaders who have the skills to extract, analyze, and visualize data. On the other hand they are partners for their functional teams to measure, support and challenge decision making and strategy.
For this position, some of the specific projects and areas for exploration will include:- How can we build a framework to measure, understand & forecast the impact of pricing changes?- As we move forward to implement personalization and segmentation technology, how can we leverage these to bring more sophistication to pricing in Domestika?- How do pricing factors influence the recurrence of purchases, user retention, and overall lifetime value of our users?- How can we leverage pricing to maximize revenue, whilst balancing value and volume in the short and long term, and how can we measure & monitor this effect?
RequirementsHigh level of SQL. You are comfortable navigating raw data and creating aggregate tables. You are comfortable doing this autonomously, but asking for help on occasion from your peers is more than ok.

It all started as an online forum and a small but dynamic showcase of creative professionals, designed to help them connect and learn from each other. Today, the online community is home to over 6 million people from around the world who are curious and passionate about learning new creative skills.

Team
Data:
The data team partners with all parts of the business to aid decision-making and define measurement frameworks across Domestika.

Pricing:
This analyst will be dedicated to the pricing team. The pricing & revenue team is responsible for setting & optimizing the pricing strategy on all Domestika products. It is part of the larger Growth group reporting to the CMO.

Projects

All Analysts in Domestika have their feet in two worlds. On the one hand they must be technical leaders who have the skills to extract, analyze, and visualize data. On the other hand they are partners for their functional teams to measure, support and challenge decision making and strategy.

For this position, some of the specific projects and areas for exploration will include:
 How can we build a framework to measure, understand & forecast the impact of pricing changes? As we move forward to implement personalization and segmentation technology, how can we leverage these to bring more sophistication to pricing in Domestika? How do pricing factors influence the recurrence of purchases, user retention, and overall lifetime value of our users? How can we leverage pricing to maximize revenue, whilst balancing value and volume in the short and long term, and how can we measure & monitor this effect?

You understand well the principles of measurement, statistics, and typical user behavior related to pricing & marketing. With all of these, you are equipped to consult on how best to measure the effect of changes, or strategies, and in turn how to improve them. AB testing digital products, in general, is something you have some experience with, but you are also aware of measurement frameworks that don’t necessarily involve formal testing, like attribution, causal impact, or regression.Curiosity & Creativity. Data at Domestika is not a service function. We are creative partners who solve problems and consult on all areas of the business. You should be ready to challenge, to analyze, to improve, to optimize, and to recommend. At the same time, you are humble, collaborative, and driven ultimately by the motivation to make Domestika an amazing experience for our users, and an amazing place to work for your friends and colleagues.Ownership & Product / Project Management.

You will also work closely with others in the data group such as Product Analytics & Data Engineering.Programming:The Programming team is responsible for setting and optimizing the strategy of our course development in Domestika.
ProjectsAll Analysts in Domestika have their feet in two worlds. On the one hand they must be technical leaders who have the skills to extract, analyze, and visualize data. On the other hand they are partners for their functional teams to measure, support and challenge decision making and strategy.
For this position, some of the specific projects and areas for exploration will include:- Which topics have a good market opportunity to develop courses?- Once we launch a course, how can we measure its quality for our users?- Can we predict and measure the incremental revenue of a course?- With segmentation & personalization, how can we find the best course for each user?

With all of these, you are equipped to consult on how best to measure the effect of changes, or strategies, and in turn how to improve them. AB testing digital products, in general, is something you have some experience with, but you are also aware of measurement frameworks that don’t necessarily involve formal testing, like attribution, causal impact, or regression.Curiosity & Creativity.

At Domestika we are hiring a Senior Data Analyst/Scientist to work closely with the Programming (Courses) team!

Domestika is the fastest-growing creative community where the best creative experts share their knowledge and skills through professionally produced online courses. It all started as an online forum and a small but dynamic showcase of creative professionals, designed to help them connect and learn from each other. Today, the online community is home to over 6 million people from around the world who are curious and passionate about learning new creative skills.

Team
Data:
The data team partners with all parts of the business to aid decision-making and define measurement frameworks across Domestika. This position is part of Growth Analytics, reporting to the Director of Growth Analytics. You will also work closely with others in the data group such as Product Analytics & Data Engineering.
Programming:
The Programming team is responsible for setting and optimizing the strategy of our course development in Domestika.

Projects

All Analysts in Domestika have their feet in two worlds. On the one hand they must be technical leaders who have the skills to extract, analyze, and visualize data. On the other hand they are partners for their functional teams to measure, support and challenge decision making and strategy.

For this position, some of the specific projects and areas for exploration will include:
 Which topics have a good market opportunity to develop courses? Once we launch a course, how can we measure its quality for our users? Can we predict and measure the incremental revenue of a course? With segmentation & personalization, how can we find the best course for each user?
Requirements
High level of SQL. You are comfortable navigating raw data and creating aggregate tables. You are comfortable doing this autonomously, but asking for help on occasion from your peers is more than ok.

You have used window functions to do more complex analyses, but if not, are happy to learn.Visualization of analysis, reporting, & models. You have used one or more of the popular visualization tools, like Tableau, Looker, or others.

You understand well the principles of measurement, statistics, and typical user behavior related to pricing & marketing. With all of these, you are equipped to consult on how best to measure the effect of changes, or strategies, and in turn how to improve them. AB testing digital products, in general, is something you have some experience with, but you are also aware of measurement frameworks that don’t necessarily involve formal testing, like attribution, causal impact, or regression.Curiosity & Creativity. Data at Domestika is not a service function. We are creative partners who solve problems and consult on all areas of the business. You should be ready to challenge, to analyze, to improve, to optimize, and to recommend. At the same time, you are humble, collaborative, and driven ultimately by the motivation to make Domestika an amazing experience for our users, and an amazing place to work for your friends and colleagues.Ownership & Product / Project Management. Seniority at Domestika is not about years of experience, it is about autonomy and impact. In this position, you will need to demonstrate ownership and leadership in your area. This means identifying opportunities, scoping and defining projects, prioritizing them, and ultimately managing and being responsible for their success.
Bonus Skills

While we certainly don’t expect you to have all of these skills from day one, we do expect you to learn and develop in each of the following five areas
Business Insight: The ability to deeply understand the problems and issues our games and business wants to solve and therefore define for yourself the right data or analysis or interpretation to lead to the right recommendations and decisionsSQL: The ability to write complex SQL queries to analyse our databases with 300+ million players, and work effectively with both Hive and relational database systems.Analytical coding: Using tools such as R, Python (and also Excel) for analytical purposesStats: Understanding the appropriate statistical or machine learning techniques to use in different circumstances.Communication: Designing good ways of communicating, visualising or reporting your results/analysis so they are clear and unambiguous
There is plenty of scope at King for you to learn from your colleagues in those areas where you have less experience, and to share your own skills where you are stronger.

Specific experience that might be helpful, but is not required, include: experience in the games industry or similarly sophisticated customer- facing digital businesses; experience in “big data” systems such as Hadoop, Hive; experience in behavioural psychology/economics; robust understanding of more advanced statistical techniques suitable for analysis of highly skewed populations; experience in predictive analytics, segmentation, and related areas; experience in experimental design; software engineering skills in Java and other languages (beyond R, Python which we use most frequently); skills with standard reporting tools such as QlikView/Tableau/etc.
